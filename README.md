# TwitchTv User View

This project was written as part of the front end certification for Free Code Camp. It pulls up a specific set of users and their information from the TwitchTv website. Part of the projects is to pull some users who are "not found", either never created or inactive accounts. It was a basic sample project in learning how to use APIs.
